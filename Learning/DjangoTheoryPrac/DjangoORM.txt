ORM: Object relational mapping
intermediary between python code and database
when we execute something in our python code the ORM allows that to also be executed in our database
"py manage.py shell" to enter shell in terminal
once in interactiveconsole we can actually use the ORM to make changes to our database
within the interactiveconsole we must import out model (in our case posts)
"from posts.models import Post
p = Post()
p.title = "my first post!"
p.save()
"
this will make a new post and use ORM to actually save it in the database
